## Why?

We exist to help people with little or no experience learn how to use technology to build cool things.  Our classes are designed to get you started in about an hour to hour and a 1/2.  We aim to provide a fun and safe place to learn cool things.  We want to make the process of starting to learn tech easy and fun.  Everyone is welcome to come and contribute and most of the classes will be free.
  
## Class Structure

We have a 5 to 10 minute presentation on the class and what it is about. This will include a demo and some basic theory  The rest of the class is hands on.  We will have to you work though the lesson.  You will be able to go at your own pace, the only thing we ask is if you speed through that you help out your fellow students.
